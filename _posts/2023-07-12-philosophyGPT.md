No, premeditated procrastination and willingly ignorant are not the same things, although they both involve a certain level of intention or choice.

Premeditated procrastination refers to the deliberate act of delaying or postponing tasks or responsibilities, even though one knows that it may have negative consequences. It involves making a conscious decision to put off important activities for various reasons, such as a lack of motivation, fear of failure, or simply enjoying short-term gratification instead of focusing on long-term goals.

On the other hand, willingly ignorant refers to a state of deliberately choosing to remain uninformed or disregarding available knowledge or information. It implies a conscious decision to avoid seeking or accepting information, often due to personal biases, preconceived notions, or a desire to maintain one's existing beliefs or worldview.

While both premeditated procrastination and willingly ignorant involve intentional actions, they are distinct concepts. Premeditated procrastination primarily deals with delaying tasks, while willingly ignorant pertains to deliberately avoiding information or knowledge.
